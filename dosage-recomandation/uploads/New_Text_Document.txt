It is used in the management and treatment of inflammatory conditions and pain.</p><p><strong>Mechanism of action:</strong></p><div> As a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Diclofenac binds and chelatesboth isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory-proprostaglandins. This agent also may inhibitCOX-2-mediated tumor angiogenesis. When inhibiting COX-2, Diclofenac may be effective in relieving pain and inflammation.</div><p><strong>Classification:</strong></p><p><strong> WHO-ATC codes:</strong></p><p><strong>

</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Special Warnings & Precautions</h3><p><strong>Cardiovascular thrombotic events:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Several COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including Myocardial infarction (MI) and Stroke, which can be fatal.</li>
	<li>However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate.</li>
	<li>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.</li>
	<li>The concurrent use of Aspirin and an NSAID, such as Diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery:</p>

<ul>
	<li>COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of Myocardial infarction and Stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e311">Contraindications</a>]</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid the use of Diclofenac in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Diclofenac is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of Cardiac ischemia.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gastrointestinal bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.</li>
	<li>These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Risk factors for GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prior history of Peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs had a greater risk for developing a GI bleed.</li>
	<li>Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding: patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral Corticosteroids, Aspirin, Anticoagulants, or Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), smoking, alcohol use, older age, and poor general health status, elderly or debilitated patients.</li>
	<li>Patients with advanced Liver disease and/or Coagulopathy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strategies to minimize the GI risks in NSAID-treated patients:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
	<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
	<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies, other than NSAIDs.</li>
	<li>Monitor for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
	<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue therapy until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
	<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose Aspirin for Cardiac prophylaxis, closely monitor for evidence of GI bleeding. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e314">Drug interactions</a></em><em>]</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hepatotoxicity:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST, included marked elevations have occured.</li>
	<li>Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with Osteoarthritis than in those with Rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
	<li>In post-marketing reports, cases of drug-induced Hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first and two months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with Diclofenac.</li>
	<li>Post-marketing surveillance has reported cases of severe Hepatic reactions, including Liver necrosis, Jaundice, Fulminant hepatitis with and without Jaundice, and Liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</li>
	<li>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with Liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., Eosinophilia, Rash, abdominal pain, Diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), Diclofenac should be <strong>discontinued</strong> immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of Hepatotoxicity (e.g., Nausea, Fatigue, Lethargy, Diarrhea, Pruritus, Jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms).</li>
	<li>If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Diclofenac immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</li>
	<li>To minimize the potential risk, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing Diclofenac with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., Acetaminophen, Antibiotics, Anti-epileptics).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hypertension:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>NSAIDs, including Diclofenac can lead to new onset of Hypertension or worsening of pre-existing Hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.</li>
	<li>Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Thiazides diuretics or Loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e314">Drug interactions</a></em><em>]</em></li>
	<li>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Heart failure and Edema:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Patients with Heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for Heart failure, and death.</li>
	<li>If they are used in patients with severe Heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening Heart failure.</li>
	<li>Avoid the use of Diclofenac in patients with severe Heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening Heart failure.</li>
	<li>Additionally, fluid retention and Edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs.</li>
	<li>Use of Diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e314">Drug interactions</a></em><em>]</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Renal toxicity and Hyperkalemia:</strong></p>

<p>Renal toxicity</p>

<ul>
	<li>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</li>
	<li>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion.</li>
	<li>In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.</li>
	<li>Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with Impaired renal function, Dehydration, Hypovolemia, Heart failure, Liver dysfunction, those taking Diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</li>
	<li>Diclofenac injection is <strong>not</strong> recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the perioperative period and who are at risk for volume depletion.</li>
	<li>Correct volume status in Dehydrated or Hypovolemic patients prior to initiating Diclofenac.</li>
	<li>Monitor Renal function in patients with Renal or Hepatic impairment, Heart failure, Dehydration, or Hypovolemia during use of Diclofenac.<em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e314">Drug interactions</a>]</em></li>
	<li>Avoid the use of Diclofenac in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function.</li>
	<li>If Diclofenac tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hyperkalemia:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including Hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without Renal impairment.</li>
	<li>In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Anaphylactic reactions:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e311">Contraindications</a></em><em>]</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exacerbation of Asthma related to Aspirin sensitivity:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A subpopulation of patients with Asthma may have Aspirin-sensitive Asthma which may include Chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps, severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm and/or intolerance to Aspirin and other NSAIDs.</li>
	<li>Because cross reactivity between Aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such Aspirin-sensitive patients, Diclofenac is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in patients with this form of Aspirin sensitivity. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e311">Contraindications</a></em><em>]</em></li>
	<li>When Diclofenac is used in patients with pre-existing Asthma (without known Aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of Asthma.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Serious skin reactions:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse events such as Exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal.</li>
	<li>These serious events may occur without warning.</li>
	<li>Discontinue the use of Diclofenac at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</li>
	<li>Diclofenac are <strong>contraindicated</strong> in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs. <em>[</em><em>Refer </em><em><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="642ea9b76b3fd6884b63e311">Contraindications</a></em><em>]</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS):</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with Diclofenac, some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling.</li>
	<li>Other clinical manifestations may include Hepatitis, Nephritis, Hematological abnormalities, Myocarditis, or Myositis, sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection.</li>
	<li>Eosinophilia is often present, because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.</li>
	<li>Early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue Diclofenac and evaluate the patient immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fetal toxicity:</strong></p>

<p>Premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later.</li>
	<li>NSAIDs including Diclofenac increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oligohydramnios/Neonatal renal impairment:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to Oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal Renal impairment.</li>
	<li>Oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation.</li>
	<li>Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation.</li>
	<li>In some post-marketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.</li>
	<li>If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit Diclofenac use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if Diclofenac treatment extends beyond 48 hours.</li>
	<li>Discontinue Diclofenac if Oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hematological toxicity:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients.This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis.</li>
	<li>If a patient treated with Diclofenac has any signs or symptoms of Anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</li>
	<li>Comorbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of Warfarin and other Anticoagulants, Antiplatelet agents (e.g., Aspirin), Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Laboratory monitoring:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Because serious GI bleeding, Hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, on long-term NSAID treatment consider monitoring patients with a CBC and chemistry profile periodically.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sun exposure</strong> (Topical solution)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Instruct patients to avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight on treated knee(s).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eye exposure: </strong>(Topical solution, Gel)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid contact with eyes and mucosa. Advise patients that if eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Oral Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Concomitant use of oral NSAIDs with Diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage, more frequent abnormal creatinine, urea and hemoglobin. Therefore, do not use combination therapy with Diclofenac sodium topical solution and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Photosensitivity:</strong> (Gel)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using topical gel.</li>
	<li>Advise patients to discontinue treatment with Diclofenac topical gel at the first evidence of sunburn.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ophthalmic solution/drops:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The refractive stability of patients undergoing corneal refractive procedures and treated with Diclofenac sodium Ophthalmic has not been established. Patients should be monitored for a year following use in this setting.</li>
	<li>With some NSAID drugs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery.</li>
	<li>There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.</li>

<p><strong>Effects on ability to drive and use machines</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Effects on ability to drive and use machines patients experiencing visual disturbances, in particular blurred vision, should refrain from driving a vehicle or operating machines.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Precaution: (General)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Diclofenac potassium tablets cannot be expected to substitute for Corticosteroids or to treat Corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of Corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue Corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of Arthritis.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ophthalmic:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Use of topical NSAIDs may result in Keratitis, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal infiltrates, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, and corneal perforation.These events may be sight threatening, should be closely monitored for corneal health.</li>
	<li>Post-marketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients experiencing complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, Diabetes mellitus, ocular surface disease (e.g., Dry eye syndrome), Rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period-of-time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events, which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.</li>
	<li>It is recommended that ophthalmic Diclofenac sodium, like other NSAIDs, be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Diclofenac is <strong>not</strong> recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the perioperative period and who are at risk for volume depletion.</li>
</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Use in Hepatic Impairment</h3><p><strong>Injection:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Orally administered Diclofenac is extensively metabolized. The pharmacokinetics of Diclofenac are similar in patients with mild Hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects Dosing adjustments in patients with mild Hepatic impairment is not necessary.</li>
	<li>The pharmacokinetics of Diclofenac was not studied in patients with moderate to severe Hepatic impairment and use in this population is not recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ophthalmic solution/drops:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The effect of Hepatic impairment on Diclofenac pharmacokinetics is not well understood; however, there were no detectable levels of drug in plasma, indicating that no measurable systemic absorption occurs following a single instillation of the ophthalmic drops.</li>
</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p><strong>Injection and Topical solution:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Infertility:</strong></p>

<p>Females</p>

<ul>
	<li>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women.</li>
	<li>Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation.</li>
	<li>Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Males:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Published studies in adult male rodents report that Diclofenac, at clinically relevant doses, can produce adverse effects on male reproductive tissues. The impact of these findings on male fertility is not clear.</li>
</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Use in Geriatrics</h3><ul>
	<li>Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions.</li>
	<li>If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects.</li>
	<li>Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.</li>
	<li>Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</li>
</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Use in Pediatrics</h3><p><strong>Tablet, Injection, Topical solution and Ophthalmic solution/drops:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transdermal patch:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The safety and effectiveness of Transdermal patch 1.3% have been established in pediatric patients 6 years and older based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies.</li>
	<li>Based on the available data from the pediatric study, the safety profile of Transdermal patch in pediatric patients is similar to that in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Transdermal patch has not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 6 years old.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gel:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Actinic keratosis is not a condition seen within the pediatric population.</li>
	<li>Diclofenac sodium should <strong>not</strong> be used by children.</li>
</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Use in Lactation</h3><p><strong>Tablet, Injection, Topical solution, Transdermal patch Gel 3% and Ophthalmic solution/drops:</strong></p>

<p>Risk summary:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Based on available data, Diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Diclofenac and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the Diclofenac or from the underlying maternal condition.</li>
</ul><h3 style="color:#ff5050;">Use in Pregnancy</h3><p>US FDA Pregnancy Category-C(Prior to 30 weeks gestation)
US FDA PregnancyCategory-D(Starting at 30 weeks gestation)</p>

<p><strong>Tablet, Injection, Topical solution, Gel, Transdermal patch:</strong></p>

<p>Risk summary</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use of NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to Oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal Renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of Diclofenac use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid Diclofenac use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy.</li>
	<li>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Diclofenac in pregnant women.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ophthalmic solution/drops:</strong></p>

<p>Teratogenic effects</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-teratogenic effects</p>

<ul>
	<li>Because of the known effects of prostaglandin biosynthesis-inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), the use of Diclofenac (Ophthalmic) during late pregnancy should be avoided.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Labor or Delivery:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tablet, Injection,Topical solution, Gel:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>There are no studies on the effects of Diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including Diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of Stillbirth.</li>
